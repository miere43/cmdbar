tinyutf.h v1.0

SUMMARY:
tinyutf is primarily for the use of utf8 encoding. There is a great website
called http://utf8everywhere.org/ that contains a lot of great info. The
gist is that utf8 is quite superior to all other encodings and should be
used for pretty much everything all the time.

This header is mostly useful for applications that want to localize or become
utf8-aware, or to future proof code. This header was especially designed to
facilitate game localization.

EXTRA INFO:
Some advantages of utf8:
* Can encode anything utf32 can encode
* Is very widely used on the web and everywhere else
* Completely backwards compatible with typical ASCII
* Operations in utf8 buffers can be coded naively as if it were a regular
old ASCII buffer
* utf8 buffers can always be treated as a naive byte buffer making the utf8
encoding scheme safe as an opaque data type
* Endianness independent
* Lexicographic sorting is identical to utf32 sorting

Unfortunately when dealing with Windows functions many APIs accept utf16
encodings in the form of wchar_t. As a response this header provides some
utilities for on-the-fly conversions to use utf16. The utf8everwhere site
makes some great arguments to defend this style, so I highly recommend
reading it if anyone cares.

CONVERSIONS:
To convert from utf8 to utf16 use tuDecode8, and pass the codepoint into the
tuEncode16 function.

As additional API there are tuWiden and tuNarrow funcs to operate on arrays.
tuWiden converts utf8 to wchar_t (utf16) and tuNarrow converts utf16 back to
utf8. Typically these helpers are to facilitate Windows APIs (pretty much
what MultiByteToWideChar was for). Each function takes as input the size of
the utf8 array, since this size should always be known. Just size the wide
array to worst case size (2x number of bytes).

One last trick on Windows is for using utf8 strings to for dealing with file
paths. Since utf8 strings cannot be forwarded directly to fopen (or similar
functions) GetShortPathName should be used. On other platforms symlinks can
be utilized.

Here is a post about this header:

CREDIT:
The utf8 encoder/decoder was written by Richard Mitton for his lovely tigr
library. His functions have been tenderly extracted and have found a new
home in this header; they form the most important part of this header so
a big thanks goes to Mitton for kindly releasing his code to public domain!
